					<h3>OWASP</h3>
					
					<p>The Open Web Application Security Project is an online community founded in 2001 with the goal of improving software security.</p>

					<p>As an organization, they release free penetation testing tools, write books on software security, and host user groups with chapters all around the world.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/list.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>OWASP Top 10</h3>
					
					<p>One of the major contributions OWASP makes to application security is the OWASP Top 10 Application Security Risks, a periodic survey of which application security risks are most prevalent.</p>

					<p>The latest edition is 2017, with prior editions in 2013, 2010, 2007, and 2003.  The authors combine data breach analysis, practitioner surveys, and the shared expertise of leaders in the field to distill the ten largest web application security risks at the present time.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/motivation.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Motivation</h3>
					
					<p>Reviewing the top ten threats will help us get a bearing on what is happening in the industry today.  Many of the top ten threats persist over time, indicating that these tend not to be ephemeral risks.</p>
					
					<p>As a logistical note, covering ten threats means we will spend an average of five minutes per threat.  This will limit how detailed we can get on any single threat, but I will have resources available if you wish to dig deeper into a particular topic.</p>

					<h3>Injection</h3>
					
					<p>SQL injection is the most common injection attack, but there are others, including LDAP injection, XPATH injection, CSV injection, etc.</p>
					
					<p>Injection attacks are possible whenever we are building strings which include untrusted information in one context to execute in another context.  This is most common when crossing language and tier boundaries.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/test.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Injection</h3>
					
					<p>SQL Injection attacks are a solved problem, yet they remain at the top of the OWASP Top 10 list because SQL injection is such an easy vector of attack and typically, websites with SQL injection vulnerabilities tend to have a host of other problems, including using sysadmin for application access and providing open access to sensitive information.</p>

					<p>In this sense, the existence of SQL injection is an organizational bellwether:  if it fails this extremely simple test, it likely has failed others.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>
					
					<p>The single best thing you can do to protect against SQL injection is to <strong>parameterize your queries</strong>.  Non-terrible ORMs and stored procedures can both do this, though it is possible to misuse either.  If you feel the urge to execute SQL passed in as a parameter, don't do it.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/police.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>
					
					<p>From there, <strong>whitelists</strong> work.  Use whitelists to limit the domain of valid values (easy in the case of numeric or enumeration data types).  Use regular expressions if it makes sense.  These whitelists should be at every level you can think of:  UI, backend application, and database.  This is a case where defense in depth makes good sense.</p>

					<p>Blacklisting particular words is <strong>not</strong> a good solution because industrious people will find ways around your blacklist.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/brick-wall.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>
					
					<p>You can also use a <strong>Web Application Firewall</strong> to intercept potentially malicious queries.  These prevent many potential attacks from getting through but they are not perfect.  It is possible to bypass Web Application Firewalls once you understand how they behave, but they will protect against the majority of noise.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/presentation.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>More Details</h3>
					
					<p>If you want a more detailed analysis of SQL injection, I have a talk on the topic:  <a href="https://CSmore.info/on/sqli">https://CSmore.info/on/sqli</a>.  Or grab a copy of the book <a href="http://tribalsql.com/">Tribal SQL</a>, in which I contributed a chapter on SQL injection.</p>

					<h3>Broken Authentication</h3>
					
					<p>Broken authentication and session management includes flaws in the frameworks we use for authentication or session management.  If an attacker is able to do something like access exposed accounts or passwords or hijack a session ID, that attacker can now impersonate a valid user.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/visitor-passes.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Broken Authentication</h3>
					
					<p>A common example of poor authentication is keeping the session ID in the query string or as part of the URL.  If this is your primary authentication mechanism, it's a bad idea because someday, one of your users will tweet a link to your site.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>
					
					<p>Store sensitive information in cookies rather than as part of the querystring or URL.  It is possible to make the latter work securely but it involves a lot more work.  ASP.Net defaults to use cookies only.</p>

					<p>If you want to screw up, you can do so with this web.config setting:</p>
					
					<pre><code data-trim><script type="text/template">
					<sessionState cookieless="UseURI" />
					</script></code></pre>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/checkpoint-charlie.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>
					
					<p>Use tried and tested authentication methods rather than rolling your own.  These are less likely to have major security vulnerabilities than code written by a team of non-specialists.  In .NET, there is the ASP.Net MVC Identity system.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/phone.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>
					
					<p>Add two-factor authentication (2FA).  There are several NuGet packages which tie together the Microsoft Identity Framework and Google Authenticator.  <a href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Adding_two-factor_authentication_to_ASP.NET">OWASP also has a tutorial on using one of them</a>.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/alarm-clock.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Other Advice</h3>
					
					<p>Find a good tradeoff between convenience and security with respect to timeouts.  Leaving a person signed in longer is convenient, but expands the window that an attacker has to squirm into a session.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/window.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Other Advice</h3>
					
					<p>There are two timeout techniques:  sliding window and fixed-length.  Sliding window moves the expiration time back with every action.  Fixed-length forces a hard stop, which you can change in web.config:</p>
					
					<pre><code data-trim><script type="text/template">
					<forms slidingExpiration="false" >
					</script></code></pre>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/alarm-clock.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Other Advice</h3>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Store credentials securely.  We'll cover good password security later.</li>
						<li>Use robust minimum password criteria.  Don't cap password lengths please!</li>
						<li>Never send passwords via e-mail.  In fact, you shouldn't know user passwords for your site--that's not secure.</li>
						<li>Protect session IDs which are in cookies by using HTTPS to transmit cookies and protecting against cross-site scripting risks.</li>

					<h3>Sensitive Data Exposure</h3>
					
					<p>Encrypt sensitive data that you need to access later.  This includes data in databases, configuration files, backups, extracts, etc.</p>
					
					<p>For data that you don't need to access later (like plaintext passwords to your systems), keep a hash of the data.  But don't use algorithms like MD5 or SHA1; they're fine for many uses, but <strong>not</strong> for secure password hashes.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>
					
					<p>Use strong adaptive algorithms for password storage.  Use key derivation functions like <strong>PBKDF2</strong> and password hashes like <strong>bcrypt</strong>, <strong>scrypt</strong>, or <strong>Argon2i</strong>.  Use a large number of iterations with a good salt.</p>
					
					<p>ASP.Net MVC 4 crypto uses PBKDF2 with 1000 iterations, but you cannot customize the number of iterations.</p>
					
					<p>Zetetic has a NuGet package which uses BCrypt and 5000 iterations of PBKDF2.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/raspberry-pi.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Solution History</h3>
					
					<p>Each method has its own weaknesses:</p>
					
					<ul>
						<li>PBKDF2 is weak against GPUs</li>
						<li>BCrypt is weak against FPGAs (exponential CPU but not exponential memory)</li>
						<li>SCrypt is strong against FPGAs (exponential CPU and exponential memory) but is newer (2009 versus 1999) and not quite as vetted</li>
						<li>The Argon2 series is even newer than SCrypt (2015) but you can scale memory and CPU independently</li>
					</ul>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/hammer.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Performance versus Safety</h3>
					
					<p>At its best, brute force is required to break hashing.  With a good hash strategy (i.e., making hashing slow), it is not financially viable to perform a brute force attack.</p>

					<p>The downside to slow hashing is that it's easier to perform a denial of service attack with mass login attempts.</p>

					<p>Be sure to salt your hashes.  A salt is a random set of bytes which are added to a password before it is hashed.  You want a separate salt per hashed item.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Taste the Rainbow Table</h3>
					
					<p>Without a good hash + salt, an attacker can use a rainbow table, which is a reverse lookup from hash to plaintext.</p>

					<img src="presentation/assets/image/RainbowTable.png" />
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/skeleton-keys.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Key Types</h3>
					
					<p>When you need to encrypt data, know the difference between symmetric and asymmetric keys.  Symmetric keys are good for internal data like credit card info, where the same machine encrypts and decrypts the data.</p>

					<p>Asymmetric keys are good when you want different computers to communicate data back and forth.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/key-hanging.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Key Security</h3>
					
					<p>Whichever you choose, secure the keys.  Don't store them in source control or config files.  Use the Data Protection API.</p>

					<p><code>System.Security.Cryptography</code> has <code>ProtectedData.Protect</code> and <code>Unprotect</code>.</p>

					<p>Valid scopes:  <code>CurrentUser</code> and <code>LocalMachine</code>.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/lockbox.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Other Tips</h3>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Use a modern version of TLS to transmit all information.  TLS 1.3 is out and 1.2 is still fine.</li>
						<li>Discard unnecessary stored data as soon as possible and don't store what you don't need.</li>
						<li>Disable autocomplete on sensitive forms and disable caching on pages with sensitive data.</li>

					<h3>XML External Entities</h3>
					
					<p>XML External Entity Injection (XXE) is an injection attack against XML parsers.  It takes advantage of the XML spec, which allows for entities within XML.  Entities are macros or placeholders that you can define in an XML file.</p>

					<p>Those entities can also include filesystem files.  XXE attacks happen when an attacker uses an XML External Entity to load data the attacker would otherwise not be able to access.</p>

					<h3>Cross-Site Scripting</h3>

					<p>Cross-site scripting is where you get a user to execute unexpected code on a website.  It is very similar to injection attacks, but focuses around JavaScript, CSS, or HTML rather than SQL, LDAP, etc.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/mirror.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Cross-Site Scripting</h3>

					<p>There are two major themes with XSS:  reflected and persistent.</p>

					<p><strong>Reflected</strong> XSS is where an attacker sends a modified link, adding malicious querystring data.  Typically, the attacker distributes the link via e-mail, social media, and on forums.  Without the link, a potential victim would not see XSS.</p>

					<p><strong>Persistent</strong> XSS is where an attacker is able to save malicious code in a database and have it appear without needing a reflection link.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/fishing.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Cross-Site Scripting</h3>

					<p>There are several things you can do once you have exploited a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability.  You can run arbitrary scripts, access objects in the DOM, and even redirect unwary users to another site, such as a phishing site meant to harvest credentials.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/levels.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>

					<p>Beat XSS with defense in depth.  First, use an output encoding library.  Microsoft has the Anti-XSS framework, which is built into .NET now:  <code>System.Web.Security.AntiXss</code> has <code>AntiXssEncoder.HtmlEncode()</code> and <code>HtmlDecode()</code> methods, as well as encoders and decoders for CSS, JavaScript, URLs, and XML.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>
					
					<p>NuGet also has the AntiXSS library, meant for old versions of the .NET Framework prior to when they built this in.  This library can encode JavaScript, XML, LDAP, CSS, etc. code.  For example:</p>
					
					<pre><code data-trim><script type="text/template">
					Microsoft.Security.Application.Encoder.JavaScriptEncode("some string");
					</script></code></pre>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/pig.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>

					<p>If you're using ASP.NET MVC, the Razor view engine auto-encodes by default when you use <code>@object</code> or <code>Html.Encode()</code>.  If you want to restore markup, use <code>Html.Raw()</code>.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/paper-stack.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>

					<p><strong>Whitelists</strong> are a viable solution, like with injection attacks.  The encoding in the libraries above is a fancy form of whitelist, but you can build your own regular expressions as well to create custom whitelists.</p>

					<h3>Potentially Dangerous Request</h3>

					<p>.NET automatically validates page inputs and protects you against accepting potential malicious scripts...but it can be a little too aggressive, like throwing this `HttpRequestValidationException` on a password column with <code>&lt;</code> in it.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Potentially Dangerous Request</h3>

					<p>In general, you want these protections, so go to web.config and make sure to set:</p>
					
					<pre><code data-trim><script type="text/template">

					</script></code></pre>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/calculator.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Potentially Dangerous Request</h3>

					<p>But you might want to narrow that down a bit.  You can do this at the page level:</p>
					
					<pre><code data-trim><script type="text/template">
					<@ Page ValidateRequest="false" OtherAttrs="OtherValues" >
					</script></code></pre>
					
					<p>In .NET 4.5 or later, you can enable or disable request validation for individual WebForms controls, like a password box.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Ignore Encoding</h3>

					<p>For ASP.Net MVC, you can decorate model attributes to ignore enoding:</p>

					[AllowHtml]
					public string Password { get; set; }

					<h3>Insecure Deserialization</h3>
					
					<p>Deserialization attacks came onto the scene in 2015, when security researchers found serialization vulnerabilities in Java.  Attackers could perform remote code execution by sending serialized code to applications which use Java's "commons collections" library, a very popular library.  Vulnerable applications included WebLogic, WebSphere, JBoss, Jenkins, etc.</p>

					<p>Since then, we've learned that .NET applications are also vulnerable.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/image/Bubbles.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.4">
					<h3>Insecure Deserialization</h3>
					
					<p>In .NET, Breeze and NancyFX had JSON deserialization flaws.  There was also an XML deserialization flaw in DotNetNuke.</p>
					
					<p>Breeze used Newtonsoft's JSON.Net parser (which is safe) in an unsafe way, using `TypeNameHandling.All` on an `Object` type:</p>

					<pre><code data-trim><script type="text/template">
					public class SaveOptions {
					 public bool AllowConcurrentSaves { get; set; }
					 public Object Tag { get; set; }
					}
					</script></code></pre>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/path.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Insecure Deserialization</h3>
					
					<p>If you deserialize into a <code>FileSystemInfo</code> object and an attacker sends a string where part of the path begins with <code>~</code> (e.g., <code>\\SomeServer\~MyShare</code>), then Windows automatically calls <code>GetLongPathName()</code> on the string.  If the path is a UNC path, Windows makes an SMB request, and an attacker might be able to perform SMB credential relaying if the attacker is on your local network.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/data.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Solutions</h3>
					
					<p>Serialize <strong>data</strong>, not objects.  If you have straight data in JSON or XML format and you prevent your deserializer from converting untrusted serialized inputs into objects, you should be safe.</p>

					<p>Deserialize objects into specific defined types, ideally classes within custom assemblies.  Don't deserialize to Object, IRunnable, or other low-level classes or interfaces.  Sealed classes can help here.</p>

					<p>Never deserialize untrusted binary objects.</p>
				</section>
				
				<section data-background-image="presentation/assets/background/lines.jpg" data-background-opacity="0.2">
					<h3>Other Solutions</h3>
					
					<ul>
						<li>Don't serialize delegates--attackers can use delegates to execute arbitrary code.</li>
						<li>Don't use .NET remoting.  If you need remoting, you deserve what you get with WCF.  Better just not to use remoting at all.</li>
						<li>If you generate the message, sign the messages as part of the serialization process and refuse to deserialize messages which are not signed.</li>
